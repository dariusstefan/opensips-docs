```sql

 ALTER TABLE dr_rules ADD COLUMN attrs CHAR(255);

```

## Script migration

### DIALPLAN module

As **dialplan** depends now on the **pcre** library, the module is no longer compiled by default, so you need to take care and remove if from **exclude_modules** list in **Makefile**. Otherwise, no other changed are required.

### PERMISSION module

If you use the **get_source_group()** function, you will need to get the output in a different way - instead of using the return code as output, the function now requires a variable as parameter to return the output.

The change is from:
```text

  $var(output) = get_source_group();

```
to
```text

  get_source_group("$var(output)");

```

### XLOG module

As the module was removed, after updating from SVN, be sure the directory **modules/xlog** is completely purged.

In your config, you just have to remove the **loadmodule** for the **xlog** module. As the syntax of the functions (now in core) didn't change, you do not have to do any other changes

### DROUTING module

The module parameter attrs_avp has changed to gw_attrs_avp

The change is from:
```c

  modparam("drouting", "attrs_avp", "$avp(dr_attrs)")

```
to
```c

  modparam("drouting", "gw_attrs_avp", "$avp(dr_attrs)")

```
