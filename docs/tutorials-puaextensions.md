**written by Anca Vamanu**

OpenSIPS has some presence extensions that offer some very interesting features:
* Get presence status from Register
* Gateway to xmpp presence
* Sending Publish and Subscribe messages using the MI interface
* Bridge Line Appearance (BLA, event: dialog;sla)
* Busy Lamp Field (BLF, event:dialog)

They are implemented as presence user agent in modules named pua_`<extension>`:
* [pua_usrloc](#pua_usrloc)
* [pua_mi](#pua_mi)
* [pua_xmpp](#pua_xmpp)
* [pua_bla](#pua_bla)
* [pua_dialoginfo](#pua_dialoginfo)

## pua_usrloc

There are still many SIP phones( especially hard phones) that do not implement presence, or not presence with a 
central server. Even so, the server is aware if the phone is online or not from whether the phone is registered or
not. This information is used by this module to send basic presence information to the Presence Server about any 
phone.
The modules parameters that can be configured are the following:
* default_domain : (mandatory) the default domain to use when constructing the presentity uri if it is missing from
recorded aor
* entity_prefix : the prefix when constructing entity attribute to be added to presence node in xml pidf. (ex: 
'pres').
You can filter for which users or phones to have this feature enabled. In the configuration file you must call the 
function **pua_set_publish** exported by the module when a Register for one ot the users is being processed. 

See here a [configuration file example](//tutorials-presence-puausrlocconfig).

It is not a must for the presence server to run on the same machine as the pua_usrloc extension, as the 
communication is through PUBLISH SIP messages. 
You can read the [modules readme here](/modules/1-11/pua_usrloc).

## pua_mi

OpenSIPS offers the possibility to publish any kind of information to the Presence Server or subscribe to the 
presence state of a resource through the MI interface. This module requires the **pua** core and at least one [MI backend module](/manual/1-11/interface-mi).

The commands and their parameters:
1. **pua_publish**
```text

 <presentity_uri> 
 <expires>
 <event package>
 <content_type>     - body type if body of a type different from default event content-type or . 
 <ETag>             - ETag that publish should match or . if no ETag
 <extra_headers>    - extra headers to be added to the request or .
 <publish_body>     - may not be present in case of update for expire

```
Example:
```text

:pua_publish:fifo_reply
sip:system@192.168.2.132
3600
presence
application/pidf+xml
.
.
<?xml version='1.0'?><presence xmlns='urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:pidf' xmlns:dm='urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:pidf:data-model'
 xmlns:rpid='urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:pidf:rpid' xmlns:c='urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:pidf:cipid' 
entity='system@domain'><tuple id='0x81475a0'><status><basic>open</basic></status></tuple><dm:person 
id='pdd748945'><rpid:activities><rpid:away/>away</rpid:activities><dm:note>CPU:16 
MEM:476</dm:note></dm:person></presence>

```
This example publishes the state of a system( CPU/MEM). This feature can be used in many applications, one example is
advertising and publishing news and offers through the presence status of a dummy SIP account.

2. **pua_subscribe**
```text

<presentity_uri>
<watcher_uri>
<event_package> 
<expires>

```
You can read the [modules readme here](/modules/1-11/pua_mi).

## pua_xmpp

This module implements a presence gateway between XMPP and SIP. It requires **pua** and **xmpp** modules.
You have to respect the uri format rules described in [link| xmpp-sip tutorial]. 
The module has one mandatory parameter:
* **server_address** - the IP address of the machine where the OpenSIPS XMPP gateway is running
Ex: modparam( "pua_xmpp", "server_address", "sip:xmppgw@10.10.10.10")

The operations performed by **pua_xmpp** module consist in translating the presence information format from xmpp
to sip and back and also dealing with logic incompatibilities( SIP is time based while XMPP is not).
In the SIP part, the module sends Subscribe messages on behalf of the xmpp users and catches Notifies in the script.
Also it detects Subscribes to users in XMPP domains and sends Subscribes with event presence.winfo to on behalf of
those users to be notified when others Subscribe to its presence.

This is achieved by calling the following functions in the script:
* **pua_xmpp_notify()**
* **pua_xmpp_req_winfo(char* request_uri, char* expires)**

See a [configuration example here](//tutorials-presence-puaxmppconfig).

You can read the [module readme here](/modules/1-11/pua_xmpp).

## pua_bla

This module implements BLA( Bridge Line Appearance ) according to draft [draft-anil-sipping-bla-03.txt](http://tools.ietf.org/draft/draft-anil-sipping-bla/draft-anil-sipping-bla-03.txt).
The implementation is compatible with Polycom phones SoundPoint IP430 SIP.

The module requires central **pua** module and a presence server( either collocated with the BLA server or remote).
It also requires to monitor Register messages which means that as pua_usrloc, it has to be collocated with the registrar or Register messages has to be forwarded to the server.
The BLA server works as a central entity that gathers bridge line information from the phones and then distributes it
to all the phones registered to the line. 
The gathering part is done by the pua_bla module, with functionalities provided by the pua module. It is achieved by 
sending Subscribe messages to the phones when registering and then catching the Notifies from the phones. The Notify
is then transformed in a Publish message and sent to the presence server. 
The presence server is the one that will deal with the distributing part. It will receive the subscribe messages from
the phones and using the published information sent by the pua_bla module, it will send Notifies with the state of the line. 
To configure the pua_bla module you can set these parameters:

* **default_domain(str)** - (mandatory) the default domain 
* **header_name(str)** -  (mandatory) the header name to be used for comprising information about the sender of the Notify in the generated Publish message; in the configuration file of the presence server the content of this header has to be given as a parameter for the handle_publish function 
* **outbound_proxy(str)** - the address of the outbound proxy if one is used
* **server_address(str)** - (mandatory) the IP address of the bla server 

To achieved the functionalities described above, the following functions exported by the pua_bla module have to be used in the script:
* **bla_set_flag**: should be called upon receiving a Register message for those registrations that are addressed to a BLA
* **bla_handle_notify**: Should be called when receiving a Notify with a BLA information ( event: dialog;sla).
See here a [configuration file example](//tutorials-presence-puablaconfig).

You can read the [module readme here](/modules/1-11/pua_bla).

## pua_dialoginfo

This module enables BLF feature in the server by monitoring and publishing dialog information to the presence server. Basically this module uses the 'dialog' module, which is a tracker for dialogs and registers callback that are called whenever a call dialog SIP message is received. These callbacks code the new state of the dialog into an application/dialog-info+xml data format text and send these to the presence server as a body for a Publish message.

Then, the rest of the job is done by the presence server. To enable handling for this event in the presence server you need to load the 'presence_dialoginfo' module that will register the 'dialog-info' event to the presence server. The presence server will receive Subscribe messages from the UA's and generate Notifies with the information received in Publish messages sent by the pua_dialoginfo module. 

See here a [configuration file example](//tutorials-presence-puadialoinfoconfig).

You can read the [modules readme here](/modules/1-11/pua_dialoginfo).
