## DB migration

The tables of several modules were extended with new fields (and the version of the tables were accordingly increased).

To migrate from any 1.6.x DB structure to 1.6.4, if using MySQL, you can use the DB update shell script provided by the OpenSIPS tarball under **scripts/mysql_update_1_6_4.sh** - you can also fetch it from SVN - http://opensips.svn.sourceforge.net/viewvc/opensips/branches/1.6/scripts/mysql_update_1_6_4.sh?view=log

## Script migration

### NATHELPER module

The **force_rtp_proxy()** function was removed and needs to be replaced with **rtpproxy_offer()** /  **rtpproxy_answer()**. The new functions take the same parameters as the old one.

Replace **force_rtp_proxy()** with **rtpproxy_offer()** when dealing with the first SDP in session (like dealing with the INVITE request) and replace **force_rtp_proxy()** with **rtpproxy_answer()** when handling the second SDP in session (200 OK INVITE reply).
