Fail2ban is a daemon that you can install to control the intrusion attempts to your systems, we can adapt it to ban attackers after they have tried to login with wrong authentication credentials.

Opensips configuration

To make opensips work with fail2ban, you will have to send the logs to a different file than /var/log/syslog

Change from:
```text
log_facility=LOG_LOCAL0
```

To:
```text
log_facility=LOG_LOCAL7
```

And from:

```text
 if (!www_authorize("", "subscriber")) {
	www_challenge("", "0");
	exit;
}
```

To:

```bash

$var(auth_code) = www_authorize("", "subscriber");
if ( $var(auth_code) == -1 || $var(auth_code) == -2 ) {
		xlog("L_NOTICE","Auth error for $fU@$fd from $si cause $var(auth_code)");
}
if ( $var(auth_code) < 0 ) {
		www_challenge("", "0");
		exit;
}

```

rsyslog configuration

Add to /etc/rsyslog.conf

```text
 local7.* /var/log/opensips.log 
```

Fail2ban configuration

Install fail2ban

```bash
 apt-get install fail2ban 
```

Add to the end of /etc/fail2ban/jail.conf this content:

```text

[opensips]
enabled  = true
filter   = opensips
action   = iptables-allports[name=opensips, protocol=all]
           sendmail-whois[name=opensips, dest=destination@example.com, sender=source@example.com]
logpath  = /var/log/opensips.log
maxretry = 5
bantime = 3600

```

Create a file in /etc/fail2ban/filter.d/opensips.conf with the content:
```bash

# Fail2Ban configuration file
#
#
# $Revision: 250 $
#

[INCLUDES]

# Read common prefixes. If any customizations available -- read them from
# common.local
#before = common.conf

[Definition]

#_daemon = opensips

# Option:  failregex
# Notes.:  regex to match the password failures messages in the logfile. The
#          host must be matched by a group named "host". The tag "<HOST>" can
#          be used for standard IP/hostname matching and is only an alias for
#          (?:::f{4,6}:)?(?P<host>\S+)
# Values:  TEXT
#

failregex = Auth error for .* from <HOST> cause -[0-9]

# Option:  ignoreregex
# Notes.:  regex to ignore. If this regex matches, the line is ignored.
# Values:  TEXT
#
ignoreregex =

```

Restart fail2ban
```text
 /etc/init.d/fail2ban restart 
```

opensips and rsyslog configuration notes for CentOS6

> [!NOTE]
> Use process above, but with some notes here

LOCAL7 is in use by boot logging on CentOS 6, so use LOCAL6 instead.

in /usr/local/etc/openssips.conf Change from:
```text
log_facility=LOG_LOCAL0
```

To:
```text
log_facility=LOG_LOCAL6
```

Add this to /etc/rsyslog.conf (near the bottom):

```text
 # logging facility for opensips
local6.* 	/var/log/opensips.log 
```

Fail2ban Installation and Configuration notes for CentOS6 

> [!NOTE]
> Use process above, but with some notes here

Follow instructions for installation here : http://www.fail2ban.org/wiki/index.php/README

Download the latest fail2ban package from : http://sourceforge.net/projects/fail2ban/files/

Run these commands:

```text
tar xvfj fail2ban-0.8.4.tar.bz2
cd fail2ban-0.8.4
python setup.py install
```

Edit configuration files /etc/fail2ban/jail.confand /etc/fail2ban/filter.d/opensips.conf as documented in the section above.

To get startup / init.d script in place on CentOS6, copy the file named redhat-initd from the files folder inside fail2ban-0.8.4 directory to /etc/init.d with the command below.

```bash
# cp redhat-initd /etc/init.d/fail2ban   
```

Ensure you check the owner and permissions of the copied file and then test the script:

```bash
# /etc/init.d/fail2ban
Usage: /etc/init.d/fail2ban {start|stop|status|restart}
# /etc/init.d/fail2ban status
Fail2ban (pid 8323) is running...
Status
|- Number of jail:	0
`- Jail list:		
# /etc/init.d/fail2ban stop
Stopping fail2ban:                                         [  OK  ]
# ps -ef | grep fail
root      8399  8235  0 13:10 pts/0    00:00:00 grep fail
# /etc/init.d/fail2ban start
Starting fail2ban:                                         [  OK  ]
# /etc/init.d/fail2ban restart
Stopping fail2ban:                                         [  OK  ]
Starting fail2ban:                                         [  OK  ]
# 
```

To ensure that fail2ban starts at startup:

```bash
# chkconfig --list fail2ban
service fail2ban supports chkconfig, but is not referenced in any runlevel (run 'chkconfig --add fail2ban')
# chkconfig --add fail2ban
# chkconfig --list fail2ban
fail2ban       	0:off	1:off	2:off	3:on	4:on	5:on	6:off
# chkconfig fail2ban on
# chkconfig --list fail2ban
fail2ban       	0:off	1:off	2:on	3:on	4:on	5:on	6:off
# 
```
