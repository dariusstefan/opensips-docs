* *db_url*: database URL
* *force_active*: flag used to disable privacy authorization checking. If set to 1, all subscriptions will be allowed.
* *pidf_manipulation*: flag to enable the features described in RFC 4827. It gives the possibility to have a permanent state notified to the users even in the case in which the phone is not online. The presence document is taken from the xcap server and aggregated together with the other presence information, if any exist, for each Notify that is sent to the watchers.
