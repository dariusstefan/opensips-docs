## ARMv7

[-Documented by Micael on [mailing list](http://lists.opensips.org/pipermail/users/2022-January/045533.html). The compiler used was gcc 10.-]

The following steps need to be taken before compiling.

* Remove the section in **Makefile.defs** that tries to detect the arm compiler version, since it is outdated. This could of course be fixed to also include newer GCC versions in the test.

* Add `-marm` to CC options to disable ARM thumb mode.

* Edit **modules/tls_wolfssl/Makfile** and `--host=arm`

Compile line is:
```bash

CC_EXTRA_OPTS="-march=armv7-a -mthumb-interwork -mfloat-abi=hard -mfpu=neon -marm" make all

```
