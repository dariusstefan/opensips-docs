## Setting up the freeDiameter libraries

This tutorial has been written for a Xubuntu 22.04 LTS, which comes with freeDiameter library v1.2.1 packages.  Other distros, such as Debian 10, are also known to offer standard package-based support for freeDiameter v1.2.1, so they are expected to be compatible just as well.

```text

sudo apt -y install libfreediameter-dev

```

## Installing the "aaa_diameter" OpenSIPS module

If you are building from source:

```bash

include_modules=aaa_diameter make install

```

  

Otherwise, if you are installing from packages, make sure to grab the **opensips-diameter-module**:

```text

sudo apt -y install opensips-diameter-module

```

## Defining a Generic Diameter Request + Answer

While the *freeDiameter* library is very robust, this also means it will be very *nitpicky* with its "known" set of Diameter Applications and Commands.  The set of currently known apps and commands (along with each command's precise AVP structure!) make up the library's **dictionary**, in freeDiameter terminology.

  

This means that before we can build and send a generic request, we must make sure to *define the request in the freeDiameter dictionary*.  You can achieve this by attaching an **;extra-avps-file:`<path-to-dictionary.opensips>`** option to the [aaa_url](/modules/3-5/aaa_diameter#param_aaa_url) modparam of **aaa_diameter**.  In order to define Apps and Command AVP structure, we have extended the classic, AAA **dictionary.opensips** AVP definitions file to support this.  See [dm_send_request](/modules/3-5/aaa_diameter#func_dm_send_request) for full examples.

  

For our case, we only need the following in *dictionary.opensips*:

  

```text

## opensips.cfg: Sending Generic Diameter Requests

OpenSIPS **3.2** and above releases offer the option of building *generic* Diameter requests with full control over the AVPs of the request, as well as full access to the content of the response.  Below is a short tutorial on how to send a Diameter request.

  

After making sure that **aaa_diameter** is loaded, start by building the request's AVP list as a JSON array:

  

```c

log_stdout = yes
...
loadmodule "aaa_diameter.so"
modparam("aaa_diameter", "fd_log_level", 0)
modparam("aaa_diameter", "realm", "diameter.test")
modparam("aaa_diameter", "peer_identity", "server")
...

```

  

```bash

# Building an sending an My-Custom-Request (92001) for the
# My Diameter Application (42)
$var(payload) = "[
	{ \"Origin-Host\": \"client.diameter.test\" },
	{ \"Origin-Realm\": \"diameter.test\" },
	{ \"Destination-Realm\": \"diameter.test\" },
	{ \"Sip-From-Tag\": \"dc93-4fba-91db\" },
	{ \"Sip-To-Tag\": \"ae12-47d6-816a\" },
	{ \"Acct-Session-Id\": \"a59c-dff0d9efd167\" },
	{ \"Sip-Call-Duration\": 6 },
	{ \"Sip-Call-Setuptime\": 1 },
	{ \"Sip-Call-Created\": 1652372541 },
	{ \"Sip-Call-MSDuration\": 5850 },
	{ \"out_gw\": \"GW-774\" },
	{ \"cost\": \"10.84\" },
	{ \"Cost-Information\": [
		{\"Unit-Value\": [{\"Value-Digits\": 1000}]},
		{\"Currency-Code\": 35}
		]}
]";

```

  

... and, finally, send the request out (in a blocking fashion, for async support, see [async dm_send_request()](/modules/3-5/aaa_diameter#idp5591744)):

  

```text

dm_send_request(42, 92001, $var(payload), $var(rpl_avps));

```

  

In this example, the Diameter Application ID is **42**, and the Command's Code is **92001**.  Finally, the response AVPs are available under `$var(rpl_avps)`.  Just use the OpenSIPS [JSON module](/modules/3-5/json) in order to parse & access them:

  

```bash

$json(rpl) := $var(rpl_avps);
xlog("Reply AVPs: $json(rpl)\n");
$var(i) = 0;
while ($json(rpl[$var(i)])) {
  xlog("   AVP: $json(rpl[$var(i)])\n");
}

```

## opensips.cfg: Processing Generic Diameter Requests

Starting with OpenSIPS **3.5**, there is the option of acting as a **Diameter Server** and process incoming Diameter requests, as well as to provide the appropriate AVPs for the Diameter answer, which may also be an error, of course.  Here are the steps to achieve this:

  

First, make sure the [event_route](/modules/3-5/event_route) module is loaded.  It is required in order to gain access to the **event_route**, which will be triggered with a **E_DM_REQUEST** event on each incoming Diameter request:

  

```c

log_stdout = yes
...
loadmodule "aaa_diameter.so"
modparam("aaa_diameter", "fd_log_level", 0)
modparam("aaa_diameter", "realm", "diameter.test")
modparam("aaa_diameter", "peer_identity", "server")

loadmodule "event_route.so"
...
event_route [E_DM_REQUEST]
{
    xlog("Req: $param(sess_id) / $param(app_id) / $param(cmd_code)\n");
    xlog("AVPs: $param(avps_json)\n");
}

```

  

Notice there are several pieces of information provided through the event's *parameters*:

* **app_id** (integer) - the Diameter Application Identifier
* **cmd_code** (integer) - the Diameter Command Code
* **sess_id** (string) - the value of either the **Session-Id** AVP, **Transaction-Id** AVP or a **NULL** value if neither of these transaction-identifying AVPs is present in the Diameter request
* **avps_json** (string) - a JSON Array containing the AVPs of the request

  

Next, the request must be processed according to the application specifications.  Effectively, the result will be a set of AVPs to be included in the answer.  Make sure to pack them as a JSON Array (similar to the input of [dm_send_request()](/modules/3-5/aaa_diameter#func_dm_send_request)), before finally calling [dm_send_answer()](/modules/3-5/aaa_diameter#func_dm_send_answer):

  

```text

  ...
  $var(ans_avps) = "[
          { \"Vendor-Specific-Application-Id\": [{
                  \"Vendor-Id\": 0
                  }] },

          { \"Result-Code\": 2001 },
          { \"Auth-Session-State\": 0 },
          { \"Origin-Host\": \"opensips.diameter.test\" },
          { \"Origin-Realm\": \"diameter.test\" }
  ]";

  if (!dm_send_answer($var(ans_avps)))
    xlog("ERROR - failed to send Diameter answer\n");

```
