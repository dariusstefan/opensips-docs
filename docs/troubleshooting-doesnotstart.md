Where to check if **OpenSIPS** does not start?

## What is the problem?

You likely have a configuration error (script error) or a file permissions error that prevents **OpenSIPS** from starting.  

First of all, you have to identify the cause of the error, so look for the **OpenSIPS** output.

## Where to look for logs

If you have **log_stderror=no** in your config file (opensips.cfg), all the logs from **OpenSIPS** will be sent to the **syslog** service, so you have the check the corresponding file, typically:
* /var/log/syslog
* /var/log/messages

You can simply check system log with:   

```bash
$ less /var/log/messages
```

Note you might need root permissions to access these files! If you do not have it, set **log_stderror=yes** in your config and you will get the log in the console.

If you have **log_stderror=yes**, you should get the log in the console where you are run **OpenSIPS**

## Reading the error logs

The logs should give you some idea about what went wrong and prevented your **OpenSIPS** to start. The info from the logs is quite comprehensive to point you the problem. Even so, it some cases you may consider increasing the verbosity of the logs by setting a higher debug level (debug=4) - it is recommended to do it if you do not see any ERROR message in the first case.

If no still no clue, use the [mailing lists](https://www.opensips.org/Support/MailingLists) to get help on this - do not forget to post the **OpenSIPS** logs in your email.
