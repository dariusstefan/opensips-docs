This section is to provide useful help in migrating your OpenSIPS installations from any release from 1.5 branch to any release from 1.6 branch.

You can find the all the new additions in 1.6.x release compiled [under this page](https://www.opensips.org/About/Version-1-6-0). Reading it may help you understand the migration / update process.

## DB migration

One table was remove, one table had its schema changed and new tables were added (corresponding to the newly added modules).

The biggest change was done in the PERMISSIONS module, where the *trusted* and *address* tables were merged into the *address* table.

You can migrate your 1.5.x DB to the 1.5.x format by using the **opensipdbctl**(deprecated)  or **osipsconsole** tools:
```text

   # opensipsdbctl migrate opensips_1_5 opensips_1_6
   or
   # osipsconsole 
   > db migrate opensips_1_5 opensips_1_6
   > quit
   # 

```
where :
* opensips_1_5 is the existing DB name corresponding to version 1.5.x format
* opensips_1_6 is the DB name to be created for 1.6.x format

> [!NOTE]
> * the old database will not be deleted, altered or changed - it will not be touched at all
> * new database will be created and data from old DB will be imported into it

Take care and edit (if necessary) the **opensipsctlrc** /  **osipsconsolerc** files if you want to customize the DB users used for accessing the new DB.

> [!NOTE]
> The migration tool is available only for MYSQL databases!

## Script migration

### OpenSIPS core

* "`$branch`" pseudovariable was replaced by "`$br`" variable

### RADIUS modules

A generic AAA interface was build in 1.6 ( very similar to the DB interface). Therefore some changes must be made in the script in the parts referring to modules that use RADIUS. First you must load the **aaa_radius** module which contains the radius implementation for the AAA interface. Second, you must change the name of the module according to the list:
* **auth_radius** modules became **auth_aaa** module
* **group_radius** module was merged with **group** module
* **uri_radius** and **uri_db** were merged with **uri** module
* **avp_radius** module does not exist anymore and its functionalities were integrated in **aaa_radius** modules

### ALIAS_DB module

* use_domain module parameter was removed as replaced by the "d" per-lookup option. 

### DISPATCHER module
* **ds_is_from_list()** replaced with a more generic function **ds_is_in_list("ip","port")**. The new function takes as parameters the IP and PORT to test against the dispatcher list, instead of using only the source IP and PORT (as ds_is_from_list()).
ds_is_from_list() == ds_is_in_list("`$si`","`$sp`")

### GROUP module

* **is_user_in()** renamed as **db_is_user_in()**
* **get_user_group()** renamed as **db_get_user_group()** 

### PERMISSIONS module

* the following script parameters are no longer used: **peer_tag_avp**, **trusted_table**, **source_col**
* **ip_addr_col** parameter was renamed as ip_col
* **tag_col** parameter was renamed as info_col
* **from_col** parameter was renamed as pattern_col 
* the new functions **check_address()**, **check_source_address()**, **get_source_group()** replace old functions **allow_address()**, **allow_source_address()**, **allow_trusted()**
### REGISTRAR module

* former global parameters like **method_filtering**, **max_contacts**, **append_branches**, **use_path**, **path_mode** and **path_use_received** are now per AOR / function parameters
* sock_flag was moved as flag of the save() function

### TM module

* **t_reply()** function does not requires any more a prior create Transaction. If no transaction is found, it will be automatically created.
* **t_cancel_branch()** take flags ("a" - cancel all branches; "o" - cancel all other branches except current; "" - current branch); **t_cancel_call()** is obsoleted and removed (same as **t_cancel_branch("a")**).

### URI module

* **check_from()**  renamed to **db_check_from()**
* **check_to()**  renamed to **db_check_to()**
* **does_uri_exist()**  renamed to **db_does_uri_exist()**
* **get_auth_id()**  renamed to **db_get_auth_id()**
